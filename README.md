# RAG-Grammar-Enhancer
This project focuses on real-time language refinement using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system will take spoken or written input, correct grammar and fluency issues, and provide context-aware translations by retrieving linguistic patterns from a vector database.
